# Fizz Buzz
The "Fizz-Buzz test" is an interview question designed to help filter out the 99.5% of programing job candidates who can't seem to program their way out of a wet paper bag. The Question is usuly posed as: 

> "*Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".*"
